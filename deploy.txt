#Make changes what ever you need in your project folder 

# submit the code in your master branch in git repository
-git status
-git add .
-git commit - m"deployment commit"
-git push origin master

Deployment Issue
###########
copied the project folder from the backup and tried to push the code in git and heroku again
so you need to take care of this issue again
install the git first and do what ever changes you want keep the reminder
set the globale git credentials user name and email (Wishvanath Sah , anandwishvanath@gmail.com)
when time on pushing your code git may ask your username and password :(anandwishvanath@gmaila.com, '******')

so now you are able to make changes on the git repo.


heroku
-------
now you need to push all the code from git repo to heroku repository 
so again you need to validate the heroku credentails
then best way to do is install the heroku cli and try to loin from cli
it will authenticate the cli from your browser, once it done now you are able to
make changes and push this remote branch to the heroku branch.
